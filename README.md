# YOLOV-Insulator-Fault-Detection
This project aims to detect insulators and their defects from images using the YOLOv7 model.
We downloaded a dataset from Roboflow, trained the YOLOv7 model on this data, evaluated the model's performance, and finally used the trained model to detect insulators and their defects in images or videos.
